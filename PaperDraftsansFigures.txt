### Should be written in the style of brief communications for Evolution.

#### Will write it how I am used to first in general report format and then convert to the brief communications in evolution format.

#### A huge amount of editing will need to be done, I have to make this good.

Introduction:

Methods: ## First pass on methods, need to describe simulation, data gathering, data treatment and data processing.
Independent multivariate normal data was simulated using the R MASS package. 
For each simulated dataset 250 individuals measured on 5 independent traits were created.
These individuals were split into 50 lines with 5 replicates per line. 
Each trait was distributed normally with mean of 0 and variance of 1.
This data was used to calculate a phenotypic covariance matrix (P) and via a MANOVA methods a genetic covariance matrix (G). The MANOVA estimation of F was used were G=(B-W)/r where B is the between covariance matrix and W is the within groups covariance matrix. 200 datasets were simulated and for each the eigenvalues of P & G were calculated and the eigenvectors of P were projected through G. 

Dealing with Pitcher's et al 2014 data.
Pitcher's et al 2014 released a data set of genetic correlation and covariance matrices. This dataset was used for this paper. The paper for each matrix in this dataset was retrieved by searching  the organism, author and publication date retrieved from Pticher's PublicIndexFinal.csv. UQ's summon 2.0 service was used tos earch for these papers and if no result was return the publication date was widened and the search was repeated using google scholar. 
All of the paper's were then manually searched for Pmatrices which were paired with the G matrices used in Pitcher's. 
If there was no clearly paired P matrix the paper was not used inthis study. 
Additionally, the following, Nor1997, Con2003, Par2005 and con1992 were also removed after the initial compilation of P matrices. 
Par2005 has missing entries in multiple rows and columns and as such was unsuitable for eigen analysis. 
Con1992 has multiple correlations >2 off the diagonal in its correlation matrix. 
This made it clearly anomalous and it was removed from the analysis.
Con2003 and Nor1997 were removed due to further inspection showing the matrices were note paired.  
Del1995 had omitted entries. However, they were all in two rows. These rows adn their associated columns were removed.

When creating the csv files of Pmatrices the trait naming was made consistent with that of the Pitcher's et al. 2014 G matrices. After all the matrices were entered a function was used to check the trait names of the G matrices against the Pmatrices. It then extract the traits shared by both the P and G matrices and create a new Psubmatrix. These submatrices were the same dimension as their paired G matrix. Pmatrices were manually paired with the G matrices using a PmatrixIndex file created based on information in the papers. The function cheked this file to retrieve the paired P & G matrix and then made the submatrix.

Every Psubmatrix was given the same name as the paired G and written as a csv file into a separate folder. The number of matrices of any one dimension was small (<25). To mitigate this a subsampling function was used to randomly slected n traits from all the matrices of size >n and create a new submatrix of those traits. Eigenanalysis was performed on each paired P and G matrix with the eigenvalues of P and G being stored. Then each eigenvector of P was projected through G with the result also being sotred.


## Got to tidy up this methods section, reduce word count, BE SUCCINCT ALEX. Maybe it is possible to omit some of this.

Results: ### Presenting only the graphs or add some other summary statistics?


#### Largely placeholders at the moment, nees extensive rewriting and changes #####

### I think figure legends are excluded from wordcount.

<Null correlation P-G if possible>
Figure1: Using simulated data with 250 individuals each measured on 5 N(0,1) traits split into 50 lines with 5 replicates per line per dataset and 200 datasets.
The phenotypic covariance was calculated and the Genetic covariance estimated using an unconstrained MANOVA method (see methods). Eigenanalysis was performed on all of these matrices and the difference of eigenvalues was taken.
Data was simulated using the multivariate normal function in the R MASS package with no covariance between sets of traits.

<Null PthroughG>
Figure2: Using simulated data with 250 individuals each measured on 5 N(0,1) traits split into 50 lines with 5 replicates per line per dataset and 200 datasets.
The phenotypic covariance was calculated and the Genetic covariance estimated using an unconstrained MANOVA method (see methods). Eigenanalysis was performed on all of these matrices and for each set of paired P and G matriceseach eigenvector of P was projected through G in the following way P'GP were P is the jth eigenvector of P.
Data was simulated using the multivariate normal function in the R MASS package with no covariance between sets of traits.

Figure3: The eigenvalues for 43 paired P and G correlation matrices each composed of 5 traits. All of the matrices have come of the data set of Pitcher's et al 2014. 18 of the matrices were already of dimension n=5 and the other 25 were gotten by randomly sampling a submatrix of the larger matrices in the data set.
Eigenanalysis was performed on these paired matrices and the difference between the eigenvalues of P and G was taken. This graph shows the difference in ordered eigenvalues.

(Maybe check/compare null histogram versus experimental version? There are Clear outliers in the histograms of eigenvalues should they be trimmed if they affect the binning excessively?)

Discussion:
Hypotheses: 

####
Underlying distributions of G are unknown so it may be difficult to rigorously test any hypotheses posed. The distribution of the different of P and G is also unknown. Leads to comparison with simulated data, qualitative rather than quantitative comparisons. 
####
Need to read more broadly to develop a much wider context for this discussion.
####
Whole article is capped at 4500 words - maybe discussion should be 2k, methods and results 5-800 words, intro 1k, conc-200? See how it goes I guess.
####

Conclusions:



##### List of article I have read/reading to keep a record.Aim for at least 10 articles a day.

#### Likely to select 10 at the start of day and go from there to reduce wasted downtime searching between papers.
#### If a reference in one o those articles seems particularly pertinent then it will be added to the list.
#### Might add relevant article to the next days pile if there does not appear to be time.
